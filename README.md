I'm an electrical engineer by profession and use programming as needed, but I will post some things here as I improve my skills across different areas.  
My experience has been with DSP, VHDL, C, assembly, python, microcontrollers, and test automation mostly.  I appreciate any comments and help.  Anyone that needs 
someone with my skillset for a project/contract feel free to ask.  I've worked in the satellite industry, laboratory controls systems, circuit design integrated with
microcontoller controls, and others on a smaller scale.  I've passed the FE exam so we can say I'm "government approved" in my field I suppose.
