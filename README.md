I'm an electrical engineer by profession and use some programming as needed, but I will post some things here as I improve my skills across different areas.  
My experience has been with DSP, VHDL, C, and test automation mostly.  I usually learn what I need as I need it then don't use it for a year or two as product 
cycles take me to different projects.  I appreciate any comments and help.
